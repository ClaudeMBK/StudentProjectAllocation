Description: This package provides efficient implementations of the Hungarian 
    algorithm and a genetic algorithm, using both R and Rcpp. These algorithms 
    are designed to solve the student-project allocation problem, where students 
    are matched to projects based on cost, preferences, or suitability. The 
    package allows users to compute optimal or near-optimal assignments and 
    evaluate assignment costs.
