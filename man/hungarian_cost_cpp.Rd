\title{Hungarian Algorithm - Total Cost Calculation}
\usage{
hungarian_cost_cpp(matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A square numeric matrix representing the cost of assigning row \code{i} to column \code{j}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the total minimal assignment cost.
}
\description{
Computes the total minimum cost of an assignment using the Hungarian algorithm
(also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm). This version returns only the cost,
not the specific assignment.
}
\examples{
cost_matrix <- matrix(c(5, 9, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 7, 6), nrow = 3)
hungarian_cost_cpp(cost_matrix)
