\title{Hungarian Algorithm - Optimal Assignment}
\usage{
hungarian_assignment_cpp(cost)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost}{A square numeric matrix representing the cost of assigning row \code{i} to column \code{j}.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of length \code{n}, where the \code{i}-th element indicates
the column assigned to row \code{i}.
}
\description{
Solves the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm and returns
the optimal assignment vector that minimizes the total cost.

The algorithm finds a perfect matching in a bipartite graph with minimum total weight,
based on the input cost matrix.
}
\examples{
cost_matrix <- matrix(c(5, 9, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 7, 6), nrow = 3)
hungarian_assignment_cpp(cost_matrix)
