\title{Hungarian Algorithm - Optimal Assignment}
\usage{
hungarian_assignment(cost)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost}{A square numeric matrix representing the cost of assigning row \code{i} to column \code{j}.}
}
\value{
An integer vector indicating the column assigned to each row.
}
\description{
Solves the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm and returns
the optimal assignment vector that minimizes total cost.

This function implements a matrix-based version of the algorithm that finds
a minimum-cost perfect matching.

\examples{
mat <- matrix(c(4, 2, 8, 7, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5), nrow = 3)
hungarian_assignment(mat)
